# 🔧 02 - Data Preprocessing

This section covers essential data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare your data for machine learning.

## Topics Covered

### Missing Data Handling
- **Complete Case Analysis** (`complete-case-analysis/`) - Analyzing complete cases
- **Numerical Imputation** (`imputing-numerical-data/`) - Mean, median, arbitrary value imputation
- **Categorical Imputation** (`handling-missing-categorical-data/`) - Frequent value and missing category imputation
- **Missing Indicators** (`missing-indicator/`) - Creating indicators for missing values
- **KNN Imputer** (`knn-imputer/`) - K-Nearest Neighbors imputation
- **Iterative Imputer** (`iterative-imputer/`) - Advanced iterative imputation

### Data Type Handling
- **Mixed Variables** (`handling-mixed-variables/`) - Working with mixed data types
- **Date and Time** (`handling-date-and-time/`) - Date/time feature engineering

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
