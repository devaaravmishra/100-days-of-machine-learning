# 🔍 03 - Exploratory Data Analysis

This section covers statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand your data.

## Topics Covered

### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics** (`descriptive-stats/`) - Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
- **Univariate Analysis** (`univariate-analysis/`) - Single variable analysis and distributions
- **Bivariate Analysis** (`bivariate-analysis/`) - Two-variable relationships and correlations
- **Automated EDA** (`pandas-profiling/`) - Quick EDA with pandas profiling

### Outlier Detection & Treatment
- **Z-Score Method** (`outlier-removal-zscore/`) - Statistical outlier detection
- **IQR Method** (`outlier-removal-iqr/`) - Interquartile Range method
- **Percentile Method** (`outlier-detection-percentiles/`) - Percentile-based detection

## Learning Objectives
