# ⚙️ 04 - Feature Engineering

This section covers feature transformation, encoding, scaling, and advanced feature engineering techniques.

## Topics Covered

### Encoding Techniques
- **Ordinal Encoding** (`ordinal-encoding/`) - Encoding ordinal categorical variables
- **One-Hot Encoding** (`one-hot-encoding/`) - Encoding nominal categorical variables
- **Binning and Binarization** (`binning-and-binarization/`) - Creating bins and binary features

### Scaling & Normalization
- **Standardization** (`standardization/`) - Z-score standardization (mean=0, std=1)
- **Normalization** (`normalization/`) - Min-max scaling (0-1 range)
- **Power Transformer** (`power-transformer/`) - Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations

### Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Feature Construction** (`feature-construction-and-splitting/`) - Creating and splitting features
- **Function Transformer** (`function-transformer/`) - Custom function transformations
- **Column Transformer** (`column-transformer/`) - Column-wise transformations
- **Sklearn Pipelines** (`sklearn-pipelines/`) - End-to-end ML pipelines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- ✅ Encode categorical variables appropriately
- ✅ Scale and normalize numerical features
- ✅ Transform features to improve model performance
- ✅ Create custom transformations
- ✅ Build complete ML pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Completed `03-exploratory-data-analysis/`
- Understanding of when to use different encoding/scaling methods

## Estimated Time

**10-14 hours** (feature engineering is crucial for model performance!)

## Key Concepts

- **Encoding**: When to use ordinal vs one-hot encoding
- **Scaling**: Impact on different algorithms (tree-based vs distance-based)
- **Transformations**: Handling skewed distributions
- **Pipelines**: Reproducible and maintainable ML workflows

## Next Steps

After completing this section, move to:
- **`05-machine-learning-algorithms/`** - Start building ML models!
